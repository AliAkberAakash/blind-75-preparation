# blind-75-preparation

This repository contains my progress and code for finishing the [Blind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) problems.

I am going to attempt these problems multiple times, so I'm keeping a track of time. You can view it [here](https://github.com/AliAkberAakash/blind-75-preparation/blob/main/progress.md).

Languages used:
- Go
- C++
- Kotlin
- Dart

### Go
I am currently learning Go. Problems that require pointers or simple loop/if-else logic I do them with Go.

### C++
I have a good amount of experience with solving problems in C++.  So whenever I need to use the stl library (stack,queue,string etc) I use C++

### Kotlin
Kotlin had been my most favourite language for a long time. I used it in Android development. If a problem requires OOP concepts I use Kotlin.

### Dart
There are very few problems with Dart in this repo as leetcode does not support it yet. But Dart is my primary language at my job, so I'll try to solve problems with dart too.
